- Hi, I’m Jim Birch, the very mildly psuedonymous online alter ego of a less-than-famous fish biologist.
- I’m an aquatic ecologist specializing in habitat use by threatened and endagered aquatic species.
- My interest other than fish include:
    - Agent based statistical modelling
    - Cross country skiing
    - Sailing
    - Canoeing
    - Climbing
- I’m looking to collaborate on anything related to any of the above!
- How to reach me:
    - twitter: @angular_fish
    - the email listed on my profile
